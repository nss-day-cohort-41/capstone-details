# Capstone Time - Getting Started

1. Your capstone is a single page app created with React.
1. **CRUD** is an easy way to get there.
1. Your capstone should include `relational` data.
1. Your capstone should demonstrate what you have learned during the first three months at NSS.
1. Share your initial idea with Brenda(or other senior instructor) and get 👍 `thumbs-up`
1. Flush out your proposal. Once complete, you will meet with an instruction team member to confirm your **realistic MVP**.

## Proposal
